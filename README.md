## Overview

This web application is built with Streamlit and powered by Scikit-Learn. It allows users to predict the species of an Iris flower based on input features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for performing classification on Iris flower data.

## Features

- Input sepal and petal measurements to predict the Iris flower species.
- Interactive user interface for easy feature input and prediction.
- Utilizes the popular Scikit-Learn machine learning library for classification.
- Educational tool for understanding basic classification techniques.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-prediction.git
   cd iris-flower-prediction

Dependencies
Streamlit: Streamlit Documentation
Scikit-Learn: Scikit-Learn Documentation
Usage
Enter the sepal and petal measurements in the input fields.
Click the "Predict" button to see the predicted Iris flower species.
The app provides both the predicted species and a probability score for the prediction.
Data Source
The Iris flower dataset used for prediction is a classic dataset available in Scikit-Learn.
